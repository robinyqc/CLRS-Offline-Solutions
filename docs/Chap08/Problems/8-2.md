> Suppose that we have an array of $n$ data records to sort and that the key of each record has the value $0$ or $1$. An algorithm for sorting such a set of records might possess some subset of the following three desirable characteristics:

> **e.** Suppose that the $n$ records have keys in the range from $1$ to $k$. Show how to modify counting sort so that it sorts the records in place in $O(n + k)$ time. You may use $O(k)$ storage outside the input array. Is your algorithm stable? ($\textit{Hint:}$ How would you do it for $k = 3$?)

**a.** Counting-Sort.

**b.** Quicksort-Partition.

**c.** Insertion-Sort.

**d.** (a) Yes. (b) No. (c) No.

**e.**

Thanks [@Gutdub](https://github.com/Gutdub) for providing the solution in this [issue](https://github.com/walkccc/CLRS/issues/150).

```cpp
MODIFIED-COUNTING-SORT(A, k)
    let C[0..k] be a new array
    for i = 1 to k
        C[i] = 0
    for j = 1 to A.length
        C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] + 1
    for i = 2 to k
        C[i] = C[i] + C[i - 1]
    insert sentinel element NIL at the start of A
    B = C[0..k - 1]
    insert number 1 at the start of B
    // B now contains the "endpoints" for C
    for i = 2 to A.length
        while C[A[i]] != B[A[i]]
            key = A[i]
            exchange A[C[A[i]]] with A[i]
            while A[C[key]] == key // make sure that elements with the same keys will not be swapped
                C[key] = C[key] - 1
    remove the sentinel element
    return A
```

In place (storage space is $\Theta(k)$) but not stable.
